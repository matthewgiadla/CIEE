            <h2>The knowledge behind how to process coffee</h2>
            <p>
                A coffee bean is actually a seed. When dried, roasted, and ground, it's used to brew coffee. If the seed isn't processed, it can be planted and grow into a coffee tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coffee seeds are generally planted in large beds in shaded nurseries. The seedlings will be watered frequently and shaded from bright sunlight until they are hardy enough to be permanently planted. Planting often takes place during the wet season, so that the soil remains moist while the roots become firmly established.
